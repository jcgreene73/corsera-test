I didn't add it as it would have been repetitive. Just remove the quot tags.&quot;

	<section id="css">
		<h2>CSS Styling</h2>
	<div2>css is styling for a website. You embed it in the HTML code or you can link it as an external file to the website. To link it, add a tag in the head section, &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="the css file to link.css"&gt;.</div2>
		<p>CSS is composed of elements, classes and id selectors. You specify the tag to apply to by just defining the tag name &#40;i.e. "p" for paragraph tags, "div" for div tags&#41;. This allows you to then define arguments about styling for the tag selected. An example would be "p &#123; color: blue; &#125;". This would style all of the "p" elements to have blue text.</p>
		<div2>Class selectors allow you to style certain pieces only as opposed to the whole document. You add the class identifier to the html tag then you add the class styling to the css document. An example would be "&lt;p class="red"&gt;Text that would be red&lt;/p&gt;" in the html document, then ".red &#123; color: red; &#125;" in the css document. A class is ALWAYS defined with a dot before the name in the CSS document.</div2>
		<p>You can also stlye items based off of their ID in the HTML document. You do so by adding a selector of #id_name in the CSS document. An example would be "#splash &#123; color: green; &#125;". This will color the text of anything with the id "splash" to green.</p>
		<p>Lastly, you can group selectors for efficiency. Add a "," after the first selector then add the next selector.</p>
		<p>Aswell, in CSS, the last declaration before the tag wins. If you only have a CSS sheet linked, that will take precedence. If you add a style tag to an HTML tag in the HTML doc, it will take precedence over the CSS sheet.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="elements_with_other_selectors">
		<p>An element with a class selector that has a CSS definition will change how the element is styled. This will add a new definition for ONLY that element when it has ONLY that class selected. You add it by using "tag.class" in the CSS document then by using "&lt;tag class="class tag"&gt;".</p>
		<p>You can also have a child selector, which will apply only when the child tag is present in the parent tag. An example, "article &gt; p". This will only apply when the child is a direct child of an element</p>
		<p>You could also have a descendant selector. In this case, any time the descendant is present, it will apply the style. An example, "article p". In this example, all "p" tags within an "article" tag will be styled, regardless of parent order.</p>
		<p>This applies to ALL selector types.</p>

		<h2>Pseudo Class Selectors</h2>
	<p>A pseudo-class selector can be defined within a preexisting selector followed by a colon then a known pseudo selector.</p>

		<div id="content1">
			<h2 class="content1">In this box is a title for the section.</h2>
		This is the content that is contained within the box of a website. <p>You create a box by adding padding and borders in the CSS sheet for the box and border id's and classes.</p>
			<p>You can make boxes in pretty much any size that you want. Just remember how you're formatting the content within the box as that will help you with the size for the box.</p>

		<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
	<p>Content should be like water, whatever you put it into, it should assume the space of what it's put into.</p>
		<p>A responsive website is a site that is designed to adapr its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid proportionbased grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.</p>
		<h4>What does this mean?</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>The sites layout should adapt to the size of the devices that it's being displayed on.</li>
		<li>Content verbosity/visual delivery will &#40;most likely&#41; change to adapt to the device.</li>
			<li>Some content may even be hidden based on the platform accessing the site.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Layout is the largest part of responsive design. The most common type of responsive design is the 12 column design, as defined by the Twitter Bootstrap. This is because 12 allows for a decent split across the webpage. It devides into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. It also allows you to split the elements up in other amounts. 9 and 3, 8 and 4, 6 3 and 3, 4 4 2 and 2, etc.</p>
		<p>The browser window is 100%. This allows you to calculate what the percent of 1 column would be. In 12 column, this is 8.33% per column.</p>
		<p>You're also not limited to having only the main grid. You can have nested grids. This allows you to sub-devide the page in to grid sections, then treat those as the 100%. This allows you to do things like devide the page into 4 4 and 4, the sub dived into 6 and 6, 3 3 3 and 3, and 4 4 and 4.</p>
		<a href="responsive.html">Here is a page with some responsive design.</a>
		<p>The content on this page is not my own, however, it provides a great reference for how to structure a responsive site as well as a great html reference for how to build it and how it should look, including meta tags to define the width parameters for the site based on the device.</p>

	<h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>
		<p>Twitter bootstrap is the most popular web frame work for web platforms. It has an emphisis on mobile device pages and provides a simple setup for web pages. The emphisis on mobile makes it so you design your site for a mobile platform first then design it for a desktop.</p>

		<h2>Bootstrap Grid System</h2>
		<p>The easiest way to create a responsive layout is by using a grid system. Any bootstrap layout will be comprised of a few div components, typically classed into the row and columns.</p>
		<p>The bootstrap grid MUST ALWAYS be inside container wrapper. You can use the container class or the container-fluid class. The container-fluid class stretches the layout the full width of the browser and provides a consistant padding around the content. Regular container class has pre-defined fixed width that is still responsive to the width of the browser.</p>
		<p>The next component of the grid is the row. It creats the hroizontal groups of columns, which means the columns interact as a group but also act separatley from other columns. It also applies a negative margine to the left and right of content, which helps to counteract the padding setup by the container class. Each column has it's own padding. If negative padding wasn't applied to the row, the padding of the container would be added to the padding of the column.</p>
